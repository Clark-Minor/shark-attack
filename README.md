## Member Contributions

Shelley Pi: Created the models for skybox, tank, shark, and water surface. Simulated water movement through phase changes with respect to time and through repeated updates of positions and normals by copying them to the graphics card at every frame. Implemented lighting for a more realistic water surface. Simulated caustics and ink through the use of gifs. Implemented HTML text canvas.

## Note:
Water caustics has no problem rendering the still image, but animation takes some time.
